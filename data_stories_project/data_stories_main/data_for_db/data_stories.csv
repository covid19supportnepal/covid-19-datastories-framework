"Your Mask Matters!","Wearing masks is pivotal and important. We all know this, however, as time wears on, we ourselves 
get weary and forget their value. This can certainly be a problem, because the coronavirus isn't letting
up anytime soon. Thus, we have created some easy to understand graphs that will display how a mask
can change a country, and by extension, your life. We have found data from many people in the united 
states who choose to wear masks or not, and then we compare this finding to states case
numbers. This should showcase a clear relationship that masks are important, so the next time you forget
one, remember, these numbers do not lie. You are risking your life, even if it seems non-trivial. Worse yet, 
you are risking someone else's life. Check out this graph here:","As that data alludes to, wearing a mask is not something that can be debated. Why, 
you may ask? Well, the bottom axis represents the State and the proportion of 'negative' responses to 'total responses' of people who want to
wear masks or not. The higher the number, the worser the state. And the vertical axis represents the number of 'infected' divided by the number
tested. As we can see, besides some outliers (unsafe states like Georgia who don't report very well, or DC), there is a general trend that the higher
the ratio of poor behavior and bad choice, then the higher the ratio of cases that are positive/total number tested. However, we know that
at this time, many are used to wearing masks more and more but getting tired of them. Thus, seeing these
statistics may be inconsequential to you, even if they do reveal somethng powerful. You may think 'what is the point?'. Well, let's bring this closer 
to home. It's often said that people take things more serious when mortality, or words associated with death come into play.
Check out this data that we have gathered, which compares those mask wearing numbers to the deaths found 
in those US Counties. And while data may be different, the virus remains the same around the world, so you can
be sure it will affect Nepali lungs just as it affects the Californian lungs. See this data here:","So there you have it, you saw how Masks relate to both coronavirus cases, and to deaths. Don't forget, this directly links to you!
You, your family, the friends you hang out with, those you come in contact with. It's all one giant network, and we rely on 
each other. Don't forget to wear your mask! Here is one final data represetnation that we think does a nice job. It shows a complete
set of information regarding wearing masks.","We hope this data visualization and information tool was helpful to you! Thank you for looking through it, and please
take this advice and keep wearing your mask, even when you don't feel like doing so. I know it's been a long time, but
this is very important.","1"
